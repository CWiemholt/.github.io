                Most of the time, I consider myself as pretty laid back. In my late 20's now, and having spent time
                in the military, I've come to appreciate the slower life. I enlisted at 17, and the image above is 
                actually a picture taken during pre-deployment in 2013. I was a Logistician for the USMC, and am 
                glad to be done with that.

                Personally, I'm looking forward to graduating this quarter!

                Shattered is a long term project that myself and some friends started working on over 10 years ago. 
                It grew out of the desire to play a Role Playing Game which wasn't as unbalanced as we wanted. After
                some initial growing pains, we as a group ended up incorporating for some timme and eventually ran
                a successful kickstarter back in 2014. Since then, with minor success and a small community we the developers
                have elected to begin work on a second edition, as the first had some pretty big errors. Growing pains I suppose!
