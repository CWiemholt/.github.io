                Most of the time, I consider myself as pretty laid back. In my late 20's now, and having spent time
                in the military, I've come to appreciate the slower life. I enlisted at 17, and the image above is 
                actually a picture taken during pre-deployment in 2013. I was a Logistician for the USMC, and am 
                glad to be done with that. 
                <br><br>
                Personally, I'm looking forward to graduating this quarter!

                      AI was an interesting course to complete. At first it was extremely difficult, due to my lack
                      of working knowledge of Linear Algebra and Stats, thankfully it was manageable. I wanted to highlight
                      this course specifically because once I got the code to work, it became immensely fascinating.
                      <br><br>
                      This class is pretty challenging, but playing a game against the AI you built and trained is pretty
                      cool, at least for me. Mine is a Tic Tac Toe agent. Which itself is a knowable game so I wreck it,
                      but it's still interesting to see it exploit mistakes, with it only being trained via rewards. It
                      had to learn the rules on it's own over 500 training sesssions.

                    For the capstone, I was lucky to actually be a team lead for a fantastic group of students. We worked on 
                    a project called <a href="https://github.com/WonderTix.com">WonderTix</a> for 
                    <a href="https://portlandplayhouse.org/"> Portland Playhouse</a>.
                    <br><BR>
                    I wanted to highlight this coursework as I am actually extremely proud of my team. Obviously, I am not the strongest web developer,
                    so having a team I could trust and had more expertise than myself was truly amazing. The project is a new idea for Capstones, where
                    there are actually multiple teams working on it at a time, overlapping 1 quarter with each team. So we joined another team, then they 
                    finished up their capstone, to be replaced by a new team who has taken over now that Spring is almost over.

                Shattered is a long term project that myself and some friends started working on over 10 years ago. 
                It grew out of the desire to play a Role Playing Game which wasn't as unbalanced as we wanted. After
                some initial growing pains, we as a group ended up incorporating for some timme and eventually ran
                a successful kickstarter back in 2014. Since then, with minor success and a small community we the developers
                have elected to begin work on a second edition, as the first had some pretty big errors. Growing pains I suppose!
