General Notes / Comments below

I guess this is for nothing down how to get stuff to work.

I started by just getting the nav-bar using flex boxes to work. After which I played around with the linking abilities.
It's a bit difficult for mme to figure out how to get stuff to center in the div's I'm making in the yellow spaces.

Like, when I put it to 50% and just want it to align center, it wont. Need to dig into that.

Alright, now I at least figured out that I had waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many center attempts in the css file.
Went through them all and just started removing ones because this div centering is annoying. I know it's something 
simple, probably a mistake from the first pass commit. Though I'm not sure what it is, going to start looking up
how to do this properly. Grrr.


Wow. So figured out the issue. I just needed to set the margin to auto in the .css file. I feel like a novice now haha.
Oh well, live and learn right?


Tech Used:

So I utilized quite a few pages from W3Schools tutorials for using CSS as well as a few HTML elements. 
In particular I ended up taking their structure for a submission form and am repurposing it for my own useage.
IE, I just needed the outline of the script, to remember what I needed to include for it to work properly.
