Tutorials I followed:

To help me get the gist of the way to implement a form. Specifically I used their example for validating the number
input. I then modified that form, in order to recieve emails.


I needed to look up how to utilize special characters, and came across this blog: 

https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-check-if-string-contains-special-characters#:~:text=To%20check%20if%20a%20string,special%20character%20and%20false%20otherwise.

From this, I learned how to utilize the test methods of a const, in order to utilize it's T/F response
in the conditional determmining is the email is valid or not. 

For simplicity, I only check that it contains the @ symbol, and no other special characters from 0-9.
